# Url-Shortcut-to-Lnk-Converter
A very small tool that converts URL shortcuts (.url extension) to normal shortcuts (.lnk extension). It supports using a custom icon file to to each shortcut converted.

It specially useful for fixing URL shortcuts created by Steam, because the URL shortcuts don't keep the icon size and they can become small randomly.
