# Url Shortcut to Lnk Converter
A very small tool that converts URL shortcuts (.url extension) to normal shortcuts (.lnk extension). It supports using a custom icon file to to each shortcut converted.

It specially useful for fixing URL shortcuts created by Steam. The URL shortcuts don't keep the icon size, they can become small randomly. Converting them to normal shortcuts fixes the problem and the icons don't change size anymore.
