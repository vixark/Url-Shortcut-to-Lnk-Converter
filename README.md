# Url Shortcut to Lnk Converter
A very small tool that converts URL shortcuts (.url extension) to normal shortcuts (.lnk extension). It supports using a custom icon file to to each shortcut converted.

It specially useful for fixing URL shortcuts created by Steam. If you customize the icon for the Steam games URL shortcuts, they may not keep the icon size after Windows restart, they can become small randomly. Converting them to normal shortcuts allows you to have a custom icon for a game that doesn't become randomly small anymore.

How to do it for Steam games shortcuts:
* Download https://github.com/vixark/Url-Shortcut-to-Lnk-Converter/releases and open 'Url Shortcut to Lnk Converter'.
* Place the Steam games shortcuts that you want to fix in any directory/folder and paste the path of the directory in 'Shortcuts Directory'.
* Leave 'Use Custom Icons' checked.
* Place your custom icons (.ICO files) with the same file name as the corresponding shortcuts in another directory/folder and paste the path of that directory in 'Custom Icons Directory'.
* Click 'Convert'.
